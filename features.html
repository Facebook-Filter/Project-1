            <p>Social Fixer has a wide range of features to make your Facebook experience better. Here are some of the popular ones:</p>
            <h2 class="feature">Filter Your News Feed</h2>
            <div class="feature-grid">
                <img src="./images/filterthenewsyouneed.png">
                <p>Powerful filtering capabilities allow you to create rules that process the posts in your feed. Hide stories by keyword, author, application, etc. Organize your feed into tabs to group posts into categories. Advanced users can even apply HTML classes to posts that match rules, and add CSS styles to customize how they appear. You're in control.</p>
            </div>
            <h2 class="feature">Filter Subscriptions</h2>
            <div class="feature-grid">
                <img src="./images/filtersubscriptions.png">
                <p>Filters are powerful, but not everyone will understand how to create them. Luckily you don't have to! Social Fixer supplies a number of pre-made Filter Subscriptions for you that you can simply add with one click. As Facebook changes, Filter Subscriptions are automatically updated for you in the background, so you never have to tweak them to keep them working correctly.</p>
            </div>
            <h2 class="feature">Hide "Sponsored" Stories (Ads) <span class="red">(Featured)</span></h2>
            <div class="feature-grid">
                <img src="./images/hideads.png">
                <p>One of the pre-made filters you can simply select is to hide "Sponsored" stories in your news feed, aka ads. Since Social Fixer works at the code level, it can see and hide posts that other tools like AdBlock can't.</p>
            </div>
            <h2 class="feature">Hide Politics <span class="red">(Featured)</span></h2>
            <div class="feature-grid">
                <img src="./images/hidepolitics.png">
                <p>Another pre-made filter you can click to add filters posts related to the 2016 U.S. Election and Politics. One click removes all the political junk from your news feed, so you can stay friends with people without seeing their political opinions.</p>
            </div>
            <h2 class="feature">Hide Posts You've Already Read <span class="red">(Featured)</span></h2>
            <div class="feature-grid">
                <img src="./images/hidepostsyouveseen.png">
                <p>With Social Fixer, you can hide posts in your news feed once you've read them. It's like email - you don't want to continue seeing emails in your Inbox after you're done with them, do you? No - you archive them. Now you can do the same thing in Facebook - "mark as read" the posts you've seen, and next time you load Facebook, you won't have to see them again. This way you can focus only on the new content.</p>
            </div>
            <h2 class="feature">Show Photo Tags</h2>
            <div class="feature-grid">
                <img src="./images/showphototags.png">
                <p>When photos are posted, Facebook automatically runs its AI to identify keywords in the photo. Social Fixer can expose these tags and show them to you when you hover over photos.</p>
            </div>
            <h2 class="feature">Expose Hidden Messages</h2>
            <div class="feature-grid">
                <img src="./images/exposehiddenmessages.png">
                <p>Facebook hides Messages sent to you if they aren't from a friend they recognize. Social Fixer alerts you to these unseen Messages so you can read them.</p>
            </div>
            <h2 class="feature">Display Tweaks <span class="red">(Featured)</span></h2>
            <div class="feature-grid">
                <img src="images/displaytweaks.png">
                <p>Change the User Interface of Facebook, from colors to fonts to sizes or anything else you want to do using custom CSS rules. If you don't know how to do this, don't worry - there's a list of tweaks to pick from, and it will keep growing as new customization options are added to Social Fixer.</p>
            </div>
            <h2 class="feature">Stay On The Most Recent Feed <span class="red">(Featured)</span></h2>
            <div class="feature-grid">
                <img src="./images/mostrecentfeed.png">
                <p>Facebook has a terrible habit of switching you back to the "Top Stories" view of your news feed, even after you've chosen to view the "Most Recent" view. Social Fixer will automatically switch you back to the Most Recent view if Facebook decides to switch you without asking.</p>
            </div>
            <h2 class="feature">Enhance Trending Stories</h2>
            <div class="feature-grid">
                <img src="./images/enhancetrendingstories.png">
                <p>Add more functionality to the Trending box by displaying summary headlines (without hovering) and adding bars that show the relative popularity of each story.</p>
            </div>
            <h2 class="feature">Stealth Mode <span class="red">(Featured)</span></h2>
            <div class="feature-grid">
                <img src="images/stealthmode.png">
                <p>Have you ever wanted to browse peoples' profiles or look at Groups or Pages without the fear of accidentally clicking "Like" or adding someone as a friend? Stealth Mode removes all of those actions, so there is no way to accidentally click and do something you don't mean to.</p>
            </div>
            <h2 class="feature">Anonymize For Screenshots</h2>
            <div class="feature-grid">
                <img src="./images/anonymizeforss.png">
                <p>If you want to post a screenshot of your screen somewhere like Reddit but you don't want to reveal your name, your friends' names, their pictures, etc, then the "Anonymize Screen" function will help. It replaces all names, profile pictures, and other identifiers with generated text, making it a one-step process to scrub your screen before taking a screenshot.</p>
            </div>
            <h2 class="feature">Data Export/Import <span class="red">(Featured)</span></h2>
            <div class="feature-grid">
                <img src="./images/dataexpimp.png">
                <p>Backup all your settings, filters, tweaks, and data at any time by exporting your user preferences. Import all or part of your data later, in a new browser, or for a friend who wants to start with all your settings.</p>
